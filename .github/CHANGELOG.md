## [3.1.1] - 10-02-2021

- feat: `await` the closing of the server to aid consumers in avoiding leaking
  async ops when performing async cleanup.

## [3.1.0] - 09-02-2021

- fix: override superagent's `getXHR` method to prevent need to supply

## [3.0.0] - 12-12-2020

- feat: **BREAKING CHANGE** support
  [superagent `.redirects(n)` API](https://visionmedia.github.io/superagent/#following-redirects),
  with a default of `0`.

The consequence of supporting the `.redirects(n)` API is that superdeno follows
a default of `0` redirects, for parity with
[supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest/blob/master/lib/test.js#L32).
If your test requires superdeno to follow multiple redirects, specify the number
of redirects required in `.redirects(n)`, or use `-1` to have superdeno follow
all redirects.
